## In this chapter
- You learn how to tackle the impossible: problems that have no fast algorithmic solution (NP-complete problems)
- You learn how to identify such problems when you see them, so you donâ€™t waste time trying to ind a fast algorithm for them.
- You learn about approximation algorithms, which you can use to ind an approximate solution to an NP-complete problem quickly.
- You learn about the greedy strategy, a very simple problem-solving strategy.
