## In this chapter
- We continue the discussion of graphs, and you learn about weighted graphs: a way to assign more or less weight to some edges.
- You learn Dijkstra’s algorithm, which lets you answer “What’s the shortest path to X?” for weighted graphs.
- You learn about cycles in graphs, where Dijkstra’s algorithm doesn’t work.
