## In this chapter

- You learn how to model a network using a new, abstract data structure: graphs.
- You learn breadth-irst search, an algorithm you can run on graphs to answer questions like, “What’s the shortest path to go to X?”
- You learn about directed versus undirected graphs.
- You learn topological sort, a diferent kind of sorting algorithm that exposes dependencies between nodes.
